- First look at the code base from DataClinic (https://github.com/tsdataclinic/PMLDataPipeline)
- Failed to run their code due to version compatibility issues. 
- Search for fixes + Issue submission on their repo.
- Seems like the training data is not easily accessible from their repo, they only provide trained models.
